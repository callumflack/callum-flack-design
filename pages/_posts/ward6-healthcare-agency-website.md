With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Ward6 is recognised as Asia Pacific's leading independent health communications agency. I helped transfer this reputation online with a mobile-first website using a JAMstack architecture that was easy to use, very fast and easy to update and maintain.

Poorly maintained content-managed websites cost significant time and effort to resurrect. To avoid this long-term expense, I researched CMS systems against a checklist of modern web development requirements, and settled on a [JAMstack](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/jamstack-ecommerce/) (JavaScript, APIs, & Markup) setup that gave us git-based content-management, flexible third-party integrations and easy local web development.

The new Ward6 website allowed us to focus on repeatably presenting and distributing first-class campaign showcases, rather than wrestling with website technologies.
