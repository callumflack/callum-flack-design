title: The developer experience matters
lede: Rather than understanding taste as the particular way a person does a thing, I will argue that it is a measurement of how well a person is able to see and act within a problem space. When business hinges on the user experience and how products make people feel, success or failure is often a matter of taste.

### The developer experience

I’m not a born developer and I don’t have the baggage of having transferred out of a decade of PHP in the early 2010s. Instead, I was a graphic designer for well over a decade before I started coding. It was a difficult process and many times I've questioned why I code. ([I've answered that question here](https://callumflack.design/blog/designers-should-code), by the way. The short answer is that the best way to control execution in web publishing is to get as close as possible to the system. That is, code.)

<!-- who wasn't employed as a developer,  -->

When I started out, there were many systems that seemed quite illogical, even ugly. As a self-learner I was _free to make my own choices in the systems and methods I used, unencumbered by dogma._ Sure, mistakes happened. But they were mine, so I never forgot them. Today, there was a lot I haven’t had to unlearn because I never learned it in the first place.

The defining emotion in learning is satisfaction: when things work, it's fun. When they don't, it's difficult. When you overcome difficulty, it's extremely gratifying.

And this is why the developer's self-agency in their choice of systems and tools matters. the "developer experience", so to speak.

If you've been pushing commits to Github, then you update code on an FTP, my gosh is it a painful and anxious experience.
