Ward 6 Digital specialised in creating sophisticated, interactive iPad-based sales tools for Pharma and Health clients. I worked with the team to modernise development processes and bring design sensibility to data-driven showcases.

The Baxter Peritoneal Dialysis app (above) was a simple value proposition project, relative to the level of interaction we had produced in other projects. I used a clean, typographic approach paired with illustration, emulating editorial graphic design. The app is brought to life by calm, measured transitions on interaction and page loads.

The Actifuse Bone Graft Substitute app held a large information set, so it's success relied on clear a information architecture and well-designed navigation. I designed the user journeys, applied a design direction across the app, and also built it, managing detailed client feedback throughout.
