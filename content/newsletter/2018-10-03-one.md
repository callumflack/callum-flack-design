Churchill said that we shape our buildings and thereafter they shape us. Let's say one intends to build a garden wall. Will it be a rock wall that you build yourself so that in 20 years time, when it's the bedrock of your garden, you can sit and enjoy it's company? Or are you getting a job done to resolve a tight urgency, because you don't really like walls, aluminium will do, you just don't want to see your neighbours? How we build something says alot about who we are and what are intention is.

In today's email, which is the very first, I wanted to quickly make the point that the choice of materials, tools and systems that we build with influence what the result looks like, and that affects how people interact with it.

Let's start at the beginning. I help agencies, institutions, small businesses and solopreneurs publish communications on the web. On these websites, I also help build customer services where data is received and acknowledged, and in return, useful data is given back. As we understand from our garden wall example, websites are no different: the tools I use to my job are dependent on context and intention, and I design for this context by choosing the right materials and tools for the website systems almost as much as actually designing and building the website interface that communicates to their audience.

Having done this for some years, I see how tightly coupled content and technology are. Content is added into and then starts to live within some technology. All the while the technology is evolving, pushing content to people in different, iterative ways. The overlapping systems that produce these communications—content, production, distribution and the end experience—are all everchanging. If you're in media of any kind—if you own a website, you're in media—then you need to understand more than something of the nature of these content-tech systems. It's my job to ensure the audience who end up experiencing this communication will experience it in the manner intended. And that usually means helping my clients understand that content-technology landscape first, so that we can choose systems that enable their intentions and context. (And before that it's pretty important to spend the time defining those contexts too. But that's for another day).

Often I see new clients stuck in old website systems. They come to me to upgrade their web communications but when I query their choice of web systems, it doesn't factor in their problem. Of course, messing about with underlying systems can be time-consuming, but more often than not, that's where the most dramatic improvements in communications effectiveness will lie. Think back to the garden wall again, and think about the lifecycle of the cheap aluminim option: it fixes a problem in the short-term but because of cost and schedule, there wasn't much leeway to enhance it. that means in the mid- to long-view it's an eyesore and it won't create value for the real estate it belongs to.

The overlapping systems that produce web communications—content, production, distribution and the end experience—each affect eachother. They _are the capability_ to deliver your communications, promises, service and intention to your audience. If the interfaces are difficult to manipulate because your templates simply aren't accessible to the designer, then it might time to upgrade to a better templating system. I've seen tremors even just at the suggestion of such an idea. Change is difficult but without adapting in this day and age, it's not a matter of standing still but of, well, being left on the platform.
