Kind Hearted Explorers —

Hello from rainy Takamatsu! I am stalking the ghosts of Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Donald Richie this week around the inland sea of Japan.

This svelte 3,000 word issue of Roden has some info on a retreat I’m running with Jan Chipchase, paying for Instagram impressions, a new episode of “On Margins,” and a buncha notes on culture and identity.

But before we get to any of that, as always, if this kinda thing ain’t your kinda thing, unsubscribing is always a single click away. No questions asked.

### Japan Retreat — Focus

<img src="/images/interesting/focusview.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" class="nl-img-fullbleed">

Last October Jan Chipchase and I ran a retreat called Focus. It took place in the rural village of Hida Furukawa.

This year we’re running it a bit father north in a farmhouse near Kanazawa, in a town called Takigahara. Focus / Takigahara takes place September 3-6.

What is it — the retreat — precisely? God … It’s sort of a … creative therapy session? That may sound totally unpalatable. But it works in practice. We hand pick as diverse a group as we can with a goal of stringing unstrung threads between disparate people and creative fields. The intent is collaboration and inspiration.

The retreat is three nights long (four-ish days). It’s limited to 15 attendees. The cost to attend is $3,150 USD. (The problem with limiting the number of attendees is that it raises the price. But the price also subsidizes the attendance of two Japanese artists.) Cost includes lodging, food, a banquet with local chefs, drinks, and excursions. Last year we did a mountain hike, a village tour, and a hot spring trip. This year we’ll do a similarly fun set of adventures. (The view above is from last year’s hike.)

Almost all tickets are sold but we set aside four tickets for our mailing lists. If you would like to purchase a ticket, please apply using this form.

We’ll pick four of you by the first week of July. You’ll then have one week to buy your ticket before we offer the spot to someone else.
