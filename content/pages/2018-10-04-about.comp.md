<!-- Hi, Callum Flack. I'm a digital designer who works fluidly across both brand and product to make pragmatic, poetic websites and apps. -->

<!-- I'm a graphic designer by trade. I've been immersed in interface design and user experience design since 2006, when I couldn't figure out how to update my MySpace profile.  -->

<!-- <p class="Lede">Hi! I'm Callum. I provide web design and technology services for business owners and creative leaders who are driven to establish trust and inspire change.</p> -->

<!-- LFunctional simplicity is the result of hard, iterative design work. but they are never simply about making things it look nice. -->

<!-- Seamless web experiences that live up to their promises create audiences and grow business. What it looks like is your promise. How it works is the measure of it. I believe that the two main factors that drive user interface excellence are design rooted in a deep understanding of user intentions, and the ability to execute that design in code. -->

<!-- Seamless web experiences that live up to their promises create audiences and grow business. What it looks like is your promise. How it works is the measure of it. I believe that the two primary factors for user interface excellence are design rooted in deep understanding of user intentions, and the ability to execute design in code. I address both by being a designer who codes: I design interfaces that live up to the brand promise, and I execute in code the stack of details that keep the promise. -->

Designing for online attention is hard. And it's doubly difficult to get good design converted into code that you can see working in the hands of your audience, on time and exceeding expectations. Unexpected consequences and unforseen scope revisions are common when design tries to become code. The communication bottleneck increases as quality assurance attempts to play catchup to the discovery of new customer intentions, feature requests, issue tracking, production management and website maintenance—I ran into all these troubles myself. So in 2010, after a decade as a graphic designer, I took matters into my own hands and decided to learn to code.

<!-- Now I can help you bridge the widening gap between design and development. -->

<!-- Cost overruns, production management, bugs issues, stre  -->

<!-- I design interfaces that live up to the brand promise, and I execute in code the stack of details that keep the promise. Which means I have to understand your intent, what what you offer to your audience. I can only do this in collaboration. So I ask my clients to participate directly with me to understand their audience, prioritise the work within constraints and define what a better tomorrow looks like. -->

<!-- successful digital products and services are made of. -->

<!-- While focussed on design, I'm also an accomplished frontend developer. Being able to code means design is no longer fanciful but rather a choice made with the knowledge of what it takes to build it. In turn, this also means greater scope understanding and better decision making, in turn allowing higher rates of design iteration. -->

Being able to code means design is no longer fanciful but rather a choice made with the knowledge of what it takes to build it. In turn, this also means greater understanding of project requirements and better decision making, allowing more confidence to focus on what matters: designing for your customer's intentions. After all, that's what why they're your customers, and that's how they'll stay your customers.

<!-- higher rates of design iteration. -->

<!-- In my spare time, I collect vinyl records of every kind. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a constant lesson in noticing details. I also write a <a target="_blank" href="https://callumflack.blog">blog</a> about these kinds of "things inbetween". -->

You can roughly break down the work I do into three parts:

- Brand identity and graphic design
- User interface design
  <!-- - Digital editorial design -->
- Frontend web development

## Experienced

Since starting out in 2000, I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for design studios, advertising agencies, startups and SMEs. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns, Australia. Before teaching myself to code websites in 2010, my career highlight was working as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London in 2006. I've also owned and run <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2452856-Callum-Flack">a few vinyl record labels in past years</a>, so I know how to create products for a niche community.

> Callum has great eye for detail, yet he also understand the "why" of things. His visual design work is top notch and understands the importance of using design as a tool to cater for user need. He immerses himself in his work, so he's very easy to collaborate with. _<a class="icon-targetblan" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhur/">Brian Hur</a>, founder of VetPronto (YCW15)_
