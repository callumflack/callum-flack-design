> Hi, I’m Callum. I'm a design-obsessed, code-based, digital craftsman. I’ve been
> designing and building brands and experiences since 2000.”

My work revolves around listening and understanding people and their challenges—clients,
collaborators and their audiences—to provide elegant, satisfying digital solutions. I'll
help you build brands and services that emotionally connect with people, and do the job
customers need you for.

## Experienced

I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for startups, design studios and
advertising agencies. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns,
Australia. Before teaching myself web programming languages in 2010, my career highlight
was a stint as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London.

## How we can work together

Based in Cairns, I currently work with local, interstate and international clients. I can
plug into a product team as a freelance designer, or work one-to-one with owners,
organisations and creators to implement their digital business vision. I also enjoy
travelling to meet in person.
