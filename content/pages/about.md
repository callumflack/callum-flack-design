> Hi, I’m Callum Flack. I'm a design-obsessed, code-based, systems-thinking craftsman. I’ve been designing and developing brands and products since 2000.

My job is to help you bridge the gap between you and your audience by understanding your unique context, designing for emotional connection, and building a digital system that satisifies you and your toughest customers years from now.

## Experienced

I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for startups, design studios and
advertising agencies. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns,
Australia. Before teaching myself web programming languages in 2010, my career highlight
was a stint as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London.

## How we can work together

[Based in Cairns](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXbsNdrAt-v), I currently work with local, Australian and international clients. I can
plug into a product team as a freelance designer, or work one-to-one with owners,
organisations and creators to implement their digital business vision. I also enjoy
travelling to meet in person.
