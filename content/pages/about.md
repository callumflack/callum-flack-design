> Hi, I’m Callum. I'm a design-obsessed, code-based, digital craftsman. I’ve been designing and building brands and experiences since 2000.”

My work revolves around listening and understanding people and their challenges—clients, collaborators and the audiences I'm building for. We all think with our gut and act with our heart. I'll help you build brands and services that emotionally connect with people. 

## Experienced

I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for startups, design studios and advertising agencies. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns. Before teaching myself web programming languages in 2010, my career highlight was a stint as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London.

## How we can work together

Based in Cairns, I currently work with local, interstate and international clients. I can plug into a product team as a freelance designer, or work one-to-one with owners, organisations and creators to implement their digital business vision. I also enjoy travelling to meet in person.

Here’s how you can engage me:

* Improve or redesign your existing website or web application.
* Create a new website or web application from scratch.
* Work as a specialist digital partner on an ongoing basis.

## Specialist collaborators

I've collected a small co-op of remote and local specialists whom I work with regularly: web engineers, search engine marketers, copywriters and photographers. Each of them I respect and recommend.
