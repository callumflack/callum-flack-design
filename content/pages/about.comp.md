<!-- Hi, Callum Flack. I'm a digital designer who works fluidly across both brand and product to make pragmatic, poetic websites and apps. -->

Hi, I'm Callum Flack. I'm a digital designer who works fluidly across graphic design, user experience design, and code to make pragmatic, poetic websites and apps. I can counsel you on define goals and intentions to design for. And I can execute the stack of details that profitable digital experiences are made of.

I'm a graphic designer by trade. I've been immersed in interface design and user experience design since 2006, when I couldn't figure out how to update my MySpace profile. I'm also an accomplished frontend developer. I learned to code so that I could gain more design control. I'm now as comfortable in a code editor as I am in design programs.

In my spare time, I collect vinyl records of every kind. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a lesson in noticing. I also write a <a target="_blank" href="https://callumflack.blog">blog</a> about these kinds of "things inbetween".

## Experienced

Since starting out in 2000, I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for startups, design studios, advertising agencies and SMEs. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns, Australia. Before teaching myself web programming in 2010, my career highlight was working as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London.
