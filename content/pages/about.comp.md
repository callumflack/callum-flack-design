<!-- Hi, Callum Flack. I'm a digital designer who works fluidly across both brand and product to make pragmatic, poetic websites and apps. -->

<!-- I'm a graphic designer by trade. I've been immersed in interface design and user experience design since 2006, when I couldn't figure out how to update my MySpace profile.  -->

<!-- <p class="Lede">Hi! I'm Callum. I provide web design and technology services for business owners and creative leaders who are driven to establish trust and inspire change.</p> -->

<!-- LFunctional simplicity is the result of hard, iterative design work. but they are never simply about making things it look nice. -->

<!-- Seamless web experiences that live up to their promises create audiences and grow business. What it looks like is your promise. How it works is the measure of it. I believe that the two main factors that drive user interface excellence are design rooted in a deep understanding of user intentions, and the ability to execute that design in code. -->

<!-- Seamless web experiences that live up to their promises create audiences and grow business. What it looks like is your promise. How it works is the measure of it. I believe that the two primary factors for user interface excellence are design rooted in deep understanding of user intentions, and the ability to execute design in code. I address both by being a designer who codes: I design interfaces that live up to the brand promise, and I execute in code the stack of details that keep the promise. -->

<!-- Designing for online attention is hard. And it's doubly difficult to get good design converted into code that you can see working in the hands of your audience, on time and exceeding expectations.  -->

<!-- Unexpected consequences and unforseen scope revisions are common when design tries to become code. The communication bottleneck increases as quality assurance attempts to play catchup to the discovery of new customer intentions, feature requests, issue tracking, production management and website maintenance—I ran into all these troubles myself. So in 2010, after a decade as a graphic designer, I took matters into my own hands and decided to learn to code. -->

<!-- Now I can help you bridge the widening gap between design and development. -->

<!-- Cost overruns, production management, bugs issues, stre  -->

<!-- I design interfaces that live up to the brand promise, and I execute in code the stack of details that keep the promise. Which means I have to understand your intent, what what you offer to your audience. I can only do this in collaboration. So I ask my clients to participate directly with me to understand their audience, prioritise the work within constraints and define what a better tomorrow looks like. -->

<!-- successful digital products and services are made of. -->

<!-- While focussed on design, I'm also an accomplished frontend developer. Being able to code means design is no longer fanciful but rather a choice made with the knowledge of what it takes to build it. In turn, this also means greater scope understanding and better decision making, in turn allowing higher rates of design iteration. -->

<!-- After all, that's what why they're your customers, and that's how they'll stay your customers. -->

<!-- My passions lie at the intersection of digital user experiences and storytelling; leading teams in reframing and reimagining complex user interactions and technology problems. In my ten years experience, I’ve built a tool chest of technical architectural skills and blended that with a user-first sensibility. I’ve become an effective bridge between the technology and creative worlds. -->

<!-- In my spare time, I collect vinyl records of every kind. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a constant lesson in noticing details. I also write a <a target="_blank" href="https://callumflack.blog">blog</a> about these kinds of "things inbetween". -->

Callum Flack is a graphic designer turned web developer. Driven by wonder, beauty and curiosity, he bridges the gap between design and code.

<!-- He is driven by wonder, beauty and curiosity. -->

<!-- Callum bridges the gap between design and code.  -->

After a successful decade as a graphic designer, he was increasingly frustrated with the development bottlenecks of implementing interface design, so in 2010, he started coding.

<!-- Unexpected consequences and unforseen scope revisions are common when design tries to become code. The communication bottleneck increases as quality assurance attempts to play catchup to the discovery of new customer intentions, feature requests, issue tracking, production management and website maintenance—I ran into all these troubles myself. So in 2010, after a decade as a graphic designer, I took matters into my own hands and decided to learn to code. -->

With a keen sense for what constitutes beautiful, actionable design, he is also able to judge the cost of design with the knowhow of a developer. This implicit understanding allows better decision making within project complexities, which creates the time and confidence to focus on what matters: executing for business goals and customer intentions.

<!-- Callum collects typefaces, records, names as tokens of small wonder. -->

<!-- When I develop websites, I'm familiar with and advocate for these tools: -->

- PostCSS or Sass
- Vue.js and Nuxt.js
- React.js and Next.js
- <a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> things like Jekyll, etc.

<!-- Through his blog, Callum places importance on the skill of writing. Not only are people more likely to pay attention to clear, concise writing, personal insight is often only gained with brutal editing. -->

## Experienced

Since 2015, Callum, his wife and their young family have lived in Cairns, Australia.

<!-- , so I know how to create products for a niche community. -->

> Callum has great eye for detail, yet he also understand the "why" of things. His visual design work is top notch and he never forgets that design serves people. He's always taking the work over the advantage line, so to speak, so he's very easy to collaborate with. **<a class="icon-targetblan" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhur/">Brian Hur</a>, Founder, VetPronto (YCW15)**
