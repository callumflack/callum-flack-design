<!-- Hi, Callum Flack. I'm a digital designer who works fluidly across both brand and product to make pragmatic, poetic websites and apps. -->

<!-- I'm a graphic designer by trade. I've been immersed in interface design and user experience design since 2006, when I couldn't figure out how to update my MySpace profile.  -->

<!-- <p class="Lede">Hi! I'm Callum. I provide web design and technology services for business owners and creative leaders who are driven to establish trust and inspire change.</p> -->

<!-- LFunctional simplicity is the result of hard, iterative design work. but they are never simply about making things it look nice. -->

Seamless web experiences that live up to their promises create audiences and grow business. What it looks like is your promise. How it works is the measure of keeping your word. I believe that the two main factors that drive user interface excellence are design that is rooted in a deep understanding of user intentions, and the ability to execute that design in code.

I design interfaces that live up to the brand promise, and I execute in code the stack of details that deliver the promise. I can only do this in collaboration with my client. So I ask my clients to participate directly with me to understand their audience, prioritise the work within constraints and define what tomorrow looks like.

<!-- successful digital products and services are made of. -->

While focussed on design, I'm also an accomplished frontend developer. Being able to code means design is no longer a daydream but a choice made with the knowledge of what it takes to build it. In turn, this also means better decision making and greater scope understanding, all of which gives room for higher rates of design iteration.

<!-- In my spare time, I collect vinyl records of every kind. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a constant lesson in noticing details. I also write a <a target="_blank" href="https://callumflack.blog">blog</a> about these kinds of "things inbetween". -->

You can roughly breakdown the work I do into three parts:

- Brand identity and graphic design
- User interface design
  <!-- - Digital editorial design -->
- Frontend web development

## Experienced

Since starting out in 2000, I've worked in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, for startups, design studios, advertising agencies and SMEs. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in Cairns, Australia. Before teaching myself to code websites (starting in 2010), my career highlight was working as a brand designer at Saatchi & Saatchi, London.
