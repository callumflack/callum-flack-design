**OceanBlue Boats had just moved** into a new warehouse space that was four times larger. I was brought in to redesign their brand and build a website that told their love for all things boating, fishing and fabrication.

Vince, the owner, knows fishing boats. The website acts as a storybook, each page is a chapter that talks about Vince's love for boats, how he grew up with them and how he loves making them for fishermen who know the difference between a reel positioned off port versus off starboard.

> We love our new website! It tells out story really well, and people just get it. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it.” — Vince Cassaniti, owner of OceanBlue Boats

I worked with [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to capture the team's love of boat building. We portrayed a tight-knit crew dedicated to their craft. We showcased their factory-sized workspace and their fabrication technology capability as uncommon local drawcards.

As our relationship continues, we'll document their work and build a library of images for ongoing brand marketing. This will position OceanBlue Boats as the premium craftspeople they are.
