**Primary Healthcare Network North Queensland** wanted to digitise the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life survey to rapidly and economically build a map of patient well-being in their service areas. We built a cut-through responsive web app that worked on any device.

Close collaboration was essential: we had to understand the use cases for the survey—now and in the future—for PHN staff, service providers and patients. Our research was comprehensive to ensure we understood PHN's requirements, and the needs of survey-takers. The better the experience, the more people will complete the survey, and the greater benefit for PHN.

We built the web app using a progressive, modular Javascript-based technology stack to allow continued iteration as customer feedback enabled it. For example, we can now implement offline capability so that an internet connection is not required to do surveys. This is useful in remote part of Queensland with little or no 3G internet coverage.

All data collected is anonymous. At survey completion, users are presented with a score that rates their quality of life. Users can share their score by email or SMS.

We also provided guides and screencasts to clearly explain to staff how the survey works, and encourage them advocate it.

We made a survey that immediately created value for PHN. It's an experience that patients and staff find fast, simple and easy. And the app is easily adaptable as PHN discovers further use cases over time. This helps PHN to collect better data and increase the quality of their services.
