With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Ward6 is recognised as Asia Pacific's leading
independent health communications agency. I helped transfer this reputation online with a
mobile-first website that was easy to use, very fast and a cinch to update.

With a small team of collaborators, we were able to implement a vision of the website of
the future: responsive, performant, simple to manage and easy to update. This workflow allowed Ward6 to focus on simply and repeatably presenting their
stories.
