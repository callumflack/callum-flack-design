With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Ward6 is recognised as Asia Pacific's leading
independent health communications agency. We helped transfer this reputation online with a
mobile-first website that was clear, easy to peruse and very fast.

With a small team of collaborators, we were able to implement a vision of the website of
the future: responsive, performant, static yet content managed, easily updated and
adapted. This workflow allowed Ward6 to focus on simply and repeatably presenting their
stories.
