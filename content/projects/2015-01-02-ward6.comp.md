With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Ward6 is recognised as Asia Pacific's leading
independent health communications agency. I helped transfer this reputation online with a mobile-first website that was easy to use, very fast and a cinch to update and maintain.

> We love our new website! It tells out story really well, and people just get it. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it.‚Äù _Jason Armstrong, Digital Director_

I argued for a move away from Wodpress. In doing so, we were able to implement a checklist of modern website workflow requirements using a [JAMstack](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/jamstack-ecommerce/) (JavaScript, APIs, & Markup): responsive, performant, git-based, simple to manage, fast and easy to update, allowing easy third-party integrations.

This website system allowed Ward6 to focus on repeatably presenting and distributing their work, rather than wrestling with website technologies.
