**I began working with The Substation** by rebuilding their website platform for efficiency and flexibility so they could spend more time building their vision instead of being stuck in technology.

As we progressed, were able to understand their vision and evolve their digital branding to match, so that their current audience and new audiences can engage intimately with new Australian art.

We targeted mobile performance in the upgrade because we wanted to fulfil the needs of real customers. For example, a person travelling home from work by tram should, upon receiving a friend's show invite, be able to buy a ticket right away, on 2 bars of 3G in the suburbs. To do this, the website performance was audited and a checklist of improvements made.

Redesigning the user experience, we prioritised events—The Substation's reason for being. Event details and the 'buy' button were brought to the forefront. Obvious navigation and event grids were designed to help people find events without effort.

Our visual design rework focussed on giving The Substation's brilliant, eclectic photography centre stage, framed by whitespace and clean typography. In the original website design, the photography was placed within the bounds of the text column. We exploded this grid system, so that images, gifs and video would immerse people in the electric world of The Substation.

Our initial remit was bug fixes yet after understanding their issues, we proposed a change of website platform to stem the constant maintenance costs draining their digital marketing effectiveness. In the process, it became easy to improve the site's content structure, usability and performance without a big time spend. With a performant codebase, we were also able to polish their visual brand.

The new website platform and branding is allowing The Substation to revitalise their digital marketing. By improving CMS access and efficiency, using a flexible development workflow and reducing website maintenance costs, they have control over their website so they can spend more time implementing their vision.
