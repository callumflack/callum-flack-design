The Substation wanted scale their digital marketing but were stuck with a Wordpress site that was hard to customise. I rebuilt their platform for
efficiency, flexibility and performance.

As we progressed, I came to understand their vision and evolved their digital branding
to match.

The visual redesign gave centre stage to each event's brilliant, eclectic photography, framing it with whitespace and clean typography. We
exploded the grid system, so that images, gifs and video would immerse people in this electric world.

Redesigning the user experience, we prioritised events. Event details and the 'buy' button were brought to the forefront. Clear navigation and
event grids allow easy persual without compromising the immersive experience.

We targeted usability and mobile performance in the upgrade to fulfil the needs of real people. For example, a person travelling home from work on public transport should be able to buy tickets from the site while in transit. To guarantee these opportunities, website performance and user flows were audited and a stack of improvements made.
