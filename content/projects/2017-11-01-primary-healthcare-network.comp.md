Primary Healthcare Network North Queensland wanted to digitise the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life survey to rapidly and economically build a map of patient well-being in their service areas. We built a cut-through responsive web app that worked on any device, and securely stored patient responses.

Close collaboration was essential: we had to understand the use cases for the survey for PHN staff, service providers and patients. The better the experience, the more people will complete the survey, and the greater benefit for PHN.

We built the app using React.js to allow flexible iteration as feedback required it. For example, we can now add offline capability into the app so that an internet connection is not required to do surveys. This is useful in remote parts of Queensland with intermittent internet coverage.

All data collected is anonymous. At survey completion, users are presented with a score that rates their quality of life. Users can share their score by email or SMS.

We also provided guides and screencasts to clearly explain to staff how the survey works, and encourage their advocacy of it.

We made a survey that immediately created value for PHN. It's an experience that patients and staff find fast, simple and easy. And the app is easily adaptable as we discover further use cases over time. This helps PHN to collect better data and increase the quality of their services.
