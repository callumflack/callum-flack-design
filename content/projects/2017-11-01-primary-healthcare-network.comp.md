Primary Healthcare Network North Queensland wanted to digitise the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life survey to rapidly and economically build a map of patient well-being in their service areas. We built a maintainable, easy to use web app that worked on any device, and securely stored patient responses.

<!-- We built the app using React.js to allow flexible iteration as feedback required it. For example, we can now add offline capability into the app without rewritting it. This may become useful in remote parts of Queensland with intermittent internet coverage. -->

Close collaboration was essential: I had to understand the use cases for the survey for PHN staff, service providers and patients. The better the experience, the more people will complete the survey, and the greater benefit for PHN.

<!-- All data collected is anonymous. At survey completion, users are presented with a score that rates their quality of life. Users can share their score by email or SMS. -->

A well-defined series of workflows with clear interface design means the app can be used with no more than general smartphone knowledge. However, I also provided guides and screencasts for staff and their patients to encourage their use.

<!-- And the app is easily adaptable as we discover further use cases over time.  -->

The resulting survey app immediately created value for PHN. It's an experience that patients and staff find fast, simple and easy. This helps PHN to collect quality data to increase the effectiveness of their services.
