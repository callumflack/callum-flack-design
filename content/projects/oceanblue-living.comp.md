OceanBlue Living were stuck with a website they couldn't update, and they badly needed to talk to their audience. After workshopping their needs and audience requirements, I designed and built a website that told a simple, powerful story of how their metalworks transform living spaces. 

> Callum showed us a bigger vision of what our works mean to people. And he's been able to convert ideas into reality. The site gets commented on all the time.” <br>— LeaAnne Cassaniti, owner of Oceanblue Living

Their metalworks are rugged and beautiful. To capture this, we hired [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/). The website design makes full use of the results, with images and sliders immersing the viewer in the variety of works.

The visual design system uses highly structured fonts, with hand-drawn icons that match the 'craftsmanship' archetype central to their brand repositioning.

The goal of the website is to become a place people can dream of their perfect home and office space, and create a community around OceanBlue's works.
