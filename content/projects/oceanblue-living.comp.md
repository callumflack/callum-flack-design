OceanBlue Living were stuck with a website they couldn't update themselves, and they badly needed to talk to their audience. After workshopping their needs and their audience requirements, we repositioned their branding and redesigned the site to build / better inform users.

Their metalworks are rugged and beautiful. We hired [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to ensure this beauty was showcased, and designed the website experience around immersive photography: full width images and sliders are used to show the variety of works.

The visual design system uses clear and simple typography, with hand-drawn icons that match the 'craftsmanship' archetype central to their brand repositioning.

The heart of the website will be the blog, a place we hope people will dream up their perfect home and office space, and create a community around OceanBlue's works.

> "Patternworks showed us a vision of our business that surpassed ours. More than that, they've made it a reality—the project execution has been just plain fun to be part of. We're very happy with the results, and it's very quickly raised our awareness two-fold." — LeaAnne Cassaniti, Oceanblue Living
