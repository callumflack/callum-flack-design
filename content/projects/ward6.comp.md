With offices in Sydney and Singapore, Ward6 is recognised as Asia Pacific's leading independent health communications agency. We helped transfer this reputation online with a mobile-first website that was clear, legible and easy to peruse.

We moved the website from Wordpress to a static site environment to increase security and performance, and enhance developer productivity. We chose Siteleaf as a CMS to sync with. This workflow greatly improves iteration and deployment speed.

With a small team of collaborators, we were able to implement a vision of the website of the future: responsive, performant, static yet content managed, easily updated and adapted. This workflow allowed Ward6 to focus on simply and repeatably presenting their stories.
