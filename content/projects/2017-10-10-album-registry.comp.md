**After setbacks and investor problems,** I was asked to help rethink what Album Registry can be, and rebuild the platform for a community of photographers around the world.

Album Registry bridges the gap between people celebrating the big moments of their lives, and professional photographers who live by their craft. We needed a way to convey the creativity and craft of photographers while giving gifters a first-class, secure e-commerce experience.

The resulting website is fully responsive, powered by a backend content management system to record and reconcile registry payments and to provide multiple levels of user access.

> We love our new website! It tells out story really well, and people just get it. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it.” — Vince Cassaniti, owner of OceanBlue Boats

As with the brand work for their sister company, Oceanblue Boats, I hired [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to capture the team's love of boat building. as the key point of difference in their brand story. Immersive photography was is used to tell that story on the website and in their marketing materials.

The Album Registry grows slowly but surely, and since joining as co-founder, we're happy to build a community around an app that helps photographers do their best.
