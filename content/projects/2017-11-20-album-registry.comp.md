After setbacks and investor problems, I was asked to help rethink what Album Registry can
be, and rebuild the platform for a community of photographers around the world.

Album Registry bridges the gap between people celebrating the big moments of their lives,
and artisinal photographers who do justice to those moments. We needed a way to showcase
what great photographers do while giving gifters a first-class, secure e-commerce
experience.

## Built for future iteration

The resulting website is fully responsive, provides many levels of user access, with a
flexible backend content management system to record registry payments and an email
notification system for admin, customers and gifters. Microservices are added when
required, so we can test and adapt quickly.

The codebase is Javascript-based, allowing us to make advantage of new developments in the
Node.js ecosystem.

We're able to design and adjust new features in the browser using the brand design system
we designed and built.

We aim to offer the Album Registry photographers an ecommerce platform, a marketing
toolkit, and a community to share with.

Album Registry grows slowly but surely, and since joining as co-founder, I'm excited to
focus on building tools that help our photographer community, and to help people give the
gift of memories.
