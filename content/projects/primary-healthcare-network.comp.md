Primary Healthcare Network North Queensland wanted to digitise the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life survey to rapidly and economically build a map of patient well-being in their service areas. We built a cut-through responsive web app that worked on any device.

Close collaboration was essential: we had to understand the use cases for the survey—now and in the future—for PHN staff, PHN service providers and their patients. Our research was comprehensive to ensure we understood who PHN's audience are, and their user needs would be.

We built the web app using a modern, progressive technology stack (that includes React.js) to allow continued iteration as customer feedback enabled it. For example, we're now implementing offline capability so that an internet connection is not required to do surveys. This is useful in remote part of Queensland with little or no 3G internet coverage.

All data collected is anonymous. At completion, users are presented with a score that rates their quality of life. Users can share this score by email or SMS.

We also provided guides and screencasts to clearly explain to staff how the survey works, and encourage them advocate it.

We made a survey that was immediately useful, and easily adaptable as PHN discovers further use cases over time. We created an experience that patients and staff find fast, simple and easy. This helps PHN to collect better data to improve their services.
