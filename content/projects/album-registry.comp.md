OceanBlue Living were stuck with a website they couldn't update themselves, and they badly needed to talk to their audience. After workshopping their needs and their audience requirements, we repositioned their branding and redesigned the site to build / better inform users.

> We love our new website! It tells out story really well, and people just get it. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it.” — Vince Cassaniti, owner of OceanBlue Boats

As with the brand work for their sister company, Oceanblue Boats, I hired [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to capture the team's love of boat building. as the key point of difference in their brand story. Immersive photography was is used to tell that story on the website and in their marketing materials.

The heart of the website will be the blog, a place we hope people will dream up their perfect home and office space, and create a community around OceanBlue's works.
