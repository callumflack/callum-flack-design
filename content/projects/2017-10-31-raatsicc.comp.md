RAATSICC is a grassroots organisation that provides much-needed social services to
help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children and families in remote far north Queensland. I helped them rethink what their website could be, creating a go-to resource for all their audiences.

I've been working with RAATSICC for over two years. Our relationship is fluent, so we're able to maintain and update their platform quickly as their needs change. This helps RAATSICC use their website to help educate and service many remote communities.
