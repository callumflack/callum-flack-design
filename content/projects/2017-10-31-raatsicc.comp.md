**RAATSICC is a grassroots organisation** that provides much-needed social services to
help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children and families in remote far north Queensland. I helped them rethink what their website could be, creating a go-to resource for all their audiences.

> We love our new website! It tells out story really well, and people just get it. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it.‚Äù _Emma Schuh, Secretary_

I've been working with RAATSICC for over two years. Our relationship is fluent, so we're able to maintain and update their platform quickly as their needs change. This helps RAATSICC use their website to help educate and service many remote communities.
