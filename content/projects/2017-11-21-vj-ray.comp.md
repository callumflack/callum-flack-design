VJ Ray Real Estate are one of Sydney's original Strata Management agencies.
They asked me to consider their customer value proposition and use it to rebuild their digital presence.

After research and discussions, it all came down to a throw-away comment from their longest-term employee: "we manage people, not just property".

My response was to focus on clarity and openness using portraits of real staff members, clear writing and accessible information flows.

Strong, clear typography is paired with the portraiture. Icons to highlight features. Information is easy to access and read.

The website never shouts. Instead, it starts by aiming to be helpful. In this way, the message is clear: VJ Ray are listening and ready to help.
