VJ Ray Real Estate are one of Sydney's original Strata Management agencies.
They asked me to consider their customer value proposition and use it to rebuild their digital presence.

During research and discussions, our goals were clarified by a throw-away comment from a long-term employee: "We manage people, not just property".

My response was to focus on putting customers first by using portraits of real staff members, a clear, fast interface design and accessible information flows with forthright messaging.

Openness, honesty and accessibility are created through the interface design and it's visual styles: strong, clear typography, icons highlight features, reduced, straightforward forms, an information architecture that is designed for speed and clarity, never wasting a person's time.

The website never shouts. Instead, it starts by aiming to be helpful. In this way, the message is clear: VJ Ray are listening and ready to help.
