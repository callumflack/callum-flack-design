OceanBlue Boats had just moved into a new warehouse space that was four times larger. I
was asked to redesign their branding and build a website around their love for all
things boating, fishing and fabrication.

Vince, the owner, knows fishing boats. The website acts as a storybook, each page is a
chapter that talks about Vince's love for boats, what the new factory workspace offers, the fabrication processes used and the base boat designs they customise.

I worked with [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to capture the tight-knit team and the workshop space in action, portraying them as uncommon
local drawcards.

As our relationship continues, we'll document their boats to build a library for
ongoing brand marketing. This will position OceanBlue Boats as the craftspeople they are.
