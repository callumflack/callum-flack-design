OceanBlue Living were stuck with a website they couldn't update, and they badly needed to talk to their audience. After workshopping their needs and audience requirements, I
designed and built a website that told a simple, powerful story of how their metalworks can transform living spaces.

Their metalworks are rugged and beautiful. To capture this, we collaborated with home and landscape specialist [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/). The website design makes full use of the results, immersing the viewer in the variety of works.

The visual design system uses highly structured fonts, with hand-drawn icons that match
the 'craftsmanship' archetype central to their brand repositioning.

> Callum showed us a bigger vision of what our works mean to people. And he's been able to convert ideas into reality. Peoplpe seem to naturally just commented on all the time, which means it's working.‚Äù _LeaAnne Cassaniti, Owner_

<!-- We continue to document new works. The image library we've built over the last 18 months allows OceanBlue Living to create high-impact social media at will. -->

The goal of the website is to become a place people can dream of their perfect home and
office space, and create a community around OceanBlue's works.
