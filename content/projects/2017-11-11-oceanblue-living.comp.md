**OceanBlue Living were stuck** with a website they couldn't update, and they badly needed
to talk to their audience. After workshopping their needs and audience requirements, I
designed and built a website that told a simple, powerful story of how their metalworks
transform living spaces.

Their metalworks are rugged and beautiful. To capture this, we collaborated with home and
landscape specialist [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/). The website design
makes full use of the results, immersing the viewer in the variety of works.

The visual design system uses highly structured fonts, with hand-drawn icons that match
the 'craftsmanship' archetype central to their brand repositioning.

<!-- We continue to document new works. The image library we've built over the last 18 months
allows OceanBlue Living to create high-impact social media at will. -->

The goal of the website is to become a place people can dream of their perfect home and
office space, and create a community around OceanBlue's works.
