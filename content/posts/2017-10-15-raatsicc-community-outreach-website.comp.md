RAATSICC is a grassroots organisation that provides social services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children and families in remote far north Queensland. I helped them rethink what their website could be, and created a performant online resource for all their audiences.

> Callum has responded to our needs by listening and helping us through the process so that we've got a website that helps us talk to out communities. We have trust and control in our relationship. _â€” Emma Schuh, Secretary_

I've been working with RAATSICC for over two years. Our relationship is fluent, so we're able to maintain and update their platform quickly as their needs change. This helps RAATSICC use their website to help educate and service many remote communities.
