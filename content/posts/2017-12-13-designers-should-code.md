The design of the screens is an arms race in the battle for your attention. How do you make better screens faster? Maybe designers should code? The answer is yes, at least to some degree. The explanation for which reveals deeper issues.

The divide in industry opinion is roughly that designers who code are "jack of all trades and master of none" versus "rare and super-powered unicorns\*". These are the extremes. But this is not a black and white issue, because software isn't simple.

Why designers shouldn't code
Because it's hard. Spending 80% of your time simulating a computer in your head leaves very little left over. And programmers are better than you.

It's really hard to master both.
"Programmers were like chess players trying to play with a blindfold on—so much of their mental energy is spent just trying to picture where the pieces are that there’s hardly any left over to think about the game itself."

The reason designers can't both design and code something that creates behaviour change in your market is it's really hard and takes a long time to do both with fluency and impact. 10,000 hours learning on each is not a rational decision.

If you can attain fluency, the thinking gears required for design and code exist in different parts of the brain, and switching contexts like that is expensive. You're required to hold two different spheres of dependencies and their feedback loops in your head when it's hard enough to simulate one complete set. I find some days go by in a blur and all there it show for it is a better linting setup.

It's not a simple split of roles.
"Good programmers and good designers are rare. It is foolish and wasteful to make them work outside of their particular special skill"

Dr Seuss one-man marching band figure

Software requires multidisciplinary skillsets. The breath of those skillsets and job roles are as wide as it is varied. Some designers don't create visuals, they create stories describing your market audience needs, and you'd call them something like service designers. Some developers don't write code (anymore), they draw system diagrams, so you'd call them something like system architects. Ever heard of a community evangelist? I think they the physical manifestation of your inbound marketing, but in person. I like that one.

As they say, the hardest thing in programming is naming things. (Which is why LinkedIn suffers form acronymn syndrome). So worry less about job titles and keep your role categorisations loose because they're bound to change. Instead, think in terms of responsibilities and know that you'll need to wear many hats and share those responsibilities if you want to make your digital product talk.

An note about 10xers.
10x programmers do exist. They find ways to get things working by 3pm which were otherwise budgeted for 5 days. Good programmers have made all the mistakes so they know the shortcuts and gotchas. I haven't seen 10x designers. Good designers have to think like their project markets through a process of research and subjective drafting. No shortcuts. (I'm talking about designing to create emotion and behaviour change, not checklisting out a dozen logos in a "99 designs" sweatshop).

Wait, should developers design?
Before we go much further, let's invert the question. Should developers design? Yes, of course. Any sufficiently advanced programmer does. "Design" is a verb for the act of creation, so it refers to the choices you make in the decision tree that makes up the thing you're making. (Which is why I'll argue that everyone designs, and every human is, by default, creative). So whatever decisions the programmer has made in their process, you'd say they've been made "by design". And the better they understand which choices to make at which times, the better programmer they will become.

Now that we've destroyed any notion of semantic labelling, why—or rather when—should designers code?

Designers should understand their medium
"The ability to implement your vision is the hallmark of great craftsmanship. It teaches you both the limits and the possibilities of your medium" — David Cole

Yes designers should code. When you know how things work, you can make better decisions. In my experience, spending time in the code trenches allows me to be self-sufficient and see further. I don't need to rely on a programmer to make code my designs, I don't need to get upset when they haven't managed to replicate the fingerspitzengefühl. I know which techniques to choose based on budget and intent.

As close and as fast as possible
“Creators need an immediate connection to what they’re creating." — Bret Victor

We all die a little when we get The Spinning Beach Ball of Death https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel. When I go back to using Gulp after working with Next.js HMR, I swear under my breath. When you're designing, you want an instant, immersive connection to the work. If you're designing for the web, nothing is closer to reality than working in real code. Your feedback is immediate, so you know what you just did works, or needs adjustment. Or perhaps you love the mistake and run with it. You do not have to ask permission to try out a visual spec for production, you can test and see straight away. There will be no abstraction in the way of your design process, and you'll design better work because of it.

Design is how it works. Good software demands many skillsets / Make better products by knowing how it works
"Doing someone else's job for awhile is a good way to gain an understanding the challenges that person faces" — Cooper

Try programming and you will quickly understand the intricate juggle of dependencies within the code and how a semicolon can break everything. Walk a mile in their shoes, and you'll realise how different you need to think before you can understand what a programmer does. And from then on feel the programmer's quiet rage when someone asks those seemingly innocuous questions using those dirty four letter words: "We really need it. Wouldn’t it be easy if we just did it like that? Can you try it real fast?".

This applies for all cross-disciplinary teams: with shared understanding, teams spend less time comprehending, and more time stacking the bricks of nuance that great digital products demand. In this way, you'll know not just how it looks but how it works. And you'll be a better designer for knowing.

Will tooling make this question irrelevant?
"Technology is on the cusp of rendering the whole debate irrelevant" — David Cole, 2013

Should we instead wait for new tools that make coding trivial? That is, wait until software eats programmers? Here's three examples of interface design and development tools I've seen in the past year that have moved the puck:

Airbnb Design's React-Sketch tool that creates React component code directly from your Sketch designs. BOOM.
I've been using a React interface library called Rebass that has been extended to create a browser design tool called Compositor. While I haven't tried Compositor yet, after using Rebass for six months it's very easy to see how a simple config file could be used to visually design and build a website with great speed (and I'm sure the styled-components source order issues while eventually sort themselves).
Finally, there's Webflow. I haven't tried it as yet, but I'll make an excuse for it on my next small project. While React-sketch and Compositor are code abstractions, Webflow hopes to handle all of your responsive website workflow, no code in sight: it's a design tool that also wants to handle all your code. It can then handle hosting and even CMS duties for you.

It's interesting to note that a <airplane computer-generated safety software> + <depasquale>

So I think David Cole is probably right: the tooling will eventually make "should designers code" an irrelevant question. But I think it's going to take a while longer than we think. Cole's comment was from 2013. Since then React has become a de facto standard, and paved the way for Vue. These tools might helps programmers make code abstractions that allow designers a closer view.

Make better software by understanding the necessary overlaps.
"The playground, asphalted and fenced in, is nothing but a pictorial acknowledgment of the fact that 'play' exists as an isolated concept in our minds. It has nothing to do with the life of play itself" — CA

Software is a wickedly complex problem and the human requirements which software is attempts to resolve are wicked to the power of ten. Take the analogy of software as a city. In "A City Is Not A Tree", Christopher Alexander describes a living, natural city as a semilattice of interconnected, overlapping elements. In contrast, an artificial city (think Brasilia) results from an artificial, tree-like organisation without overlaps: "no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the medium of the unit as a whole". It is as if "member of a family were not free to make friends outside their family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship". When we reduce our internal maps to neat explanations, we lose the rich fabric of interconnections in reality.

Should the designer understand the forces the coder has to deal with? Yes. Should developers know who the product audience is and that aesthetics create emotions? Yes. Should the CEO watch his customers interact with the product? Yes. Should we all be expected to be production-level craftsman of more than one complex practise? No.

"Should designers code?" is a misleading question that ends with a general lesson, as Alan Cooper says, "that doing someone else's job for a while is a good way to gain an understanding of that person's challenges". So be the curious fox. Or know enough to hire one. The more you're aware of the languages, limits and necessary overlaps of the "hats" within your software creation process, the better chance your digital product stands to resonate with real people.
