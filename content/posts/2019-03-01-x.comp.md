lede: Rather than understanding taste as the particular way a person does a thing, I will argue that it is a measurement of how well a person is able to see and act within a problem space. When business hinges on the user experience and how products make people feel, success or failure is often a matter of taste.

<!-- Build better websites with Reactive Javascript and the Jamstack -->

Last weekend, as I chatted to the mechanic who was diagnosing why our car wouldn’t start, he said “I charged my pressurised tyre jack last night but forgot to put it back in the truck. So this morning I’ve already done two manual tyre changes. What normally takes me five minutes took 25 minutes.” The clincher was what he said next:

> _You don’t miss good tools until you have to use the old tools._

<!-- ## The best tools for the job are ever-sharpening themselves -->
## The platform wars spawned better tools

The web is a quarter century young and all the tools we use to make the web are mutating works in progress. We're seeing platform maturity this decade after the Cambrian explosion of an entirely new medium. This maturity is the result of a second generation of tooling methods that have been driven by the platforms themselves, well honed in the battle for your eyeballs. So it won't surprise you if I tell you _there is a paradigm shift happening in modern web development_.

<!-- ## Proprietary bundled legacy systems are being unbundled -->
## Proprietary web publishing is being unbundled

Let me give you an example. Some of my clients have small- to medium-sized legacy websites on Wordpress. By legacy, I mean that these websites have been alive for a number of years, I've inherited the project and it's my job to maintain and extend it's lifespan. Because they need a website. _Despite all the social media publishing platforms available, a website is still where a business can retain most control over the presentation of their value proposition,_ and it's probably still the first thing a potential customer will click through to from a search.

_The problem I've seen lately is that these kinds of legacy websites are slow, graceless experiences and my client's audience are starting to sense it_. So they're asking me to upgrade these experiences but a quick glance at the codebase tells me 1) it's no wonder they're slow and graceless, and 2) I know there's a better way to do this.

And this better way starts by understanding two important facts:

- _**APIs change everything.**_ In the past, bundling features into a web publishing tool made sense. It wasn't easy to integrate services with an external API because the technology wasn't available. But now it is. So instead waiting for your publishing platform to become a swiss army knife, you can choose to integrate an API-based service who lives and dies by doing that one service better they ever will.

- _**Microservices can afford to do a better job.**_ In the past, your website publishing platform was probably what we now know as a CMS. Like Wordpress. This platform would handle not only the CMS but also the building of your user interfaces. Today the UI build doesn't need to be tied to the publishing platform, and there are better tools for that job that will never be integrated back into the older publishing systems because backward-compatibility prevents it. 

<!-- with what originally made their system a success: they literally have too much legacy to overcome. -->

## The paradigm shift in modern web development

I think we’re seeing _a generational shift in web development between the proprietary bundled legacy systems of the dominant web publishing platforms from 5-10 years ago as they struggle to modernise and compete against the fundamentally different approaches of modern web development,_ where a multiplicity of unbundled open-source and freemium services can be integrated together in a technology stack customised to business requirements.

With the knowledge that proprietary web publishing systems can't offer the quality of an unbundled dedicated API-based service, let me introduce some new tools that will help you sidestep your legacy website and leverage this paradigm shift.

**Reactive Javascript libraries.** As [websites become the new cities](https://pioneer.app/blog/2019-frontier-markets/), platforms have pushed for better tools to build interfaces that are robust, flexible and performant. The reactive programming paradigm is a solution to this problem. Beginning in 2013 with React.js and Vue.js 9 months later, _Reactive Javascript libraries have proven to be a faster, more productive and highly flexible method for building user interfaces (UIs)._

**The Jamstack.** Building your website system with a JAMstack architecture that does away with backend servers…

Combining this approach with reusable APIs and prebuilt markup (that is, web pages are prebuilt and delivered to your browser with speed of a cached CDN, rather than be dynamically put built on the fly from a database and a remote server before delivery). This creates _a new way of building websites with not just the advantages of a better interfaces but also higher security, a far lower cost of scaling, a simpler developer experience and no backend._ 

Yep, that's right: no backend operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. Like outsourcing services to third parties through an API, hosting is also outsourced by [WebHooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) that prebuild a completely new version of the website on every publish.

_This approach to integrating and deploying content and services into your UI is called the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)_: client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs and prebuilt Markup. … world, architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. … The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. … When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.

It's also worth noting that I'm not unveiling anything new here. Reactive Javascript libraries and the JAMstack aren't shiny new objects, but rather website development techniques I've been playing with since 2013.

<!-- ## This shift is an opportunity -->
<!-- ## Don't let hindsight become painful -->
## What happens next

Sometimes it's hard to see change happening in the moment. It's either too slow for us to notice in realtime, like a plant growing, or because we don't see the second- or third-order effects until well after the change has happened, like looking in the rearview mirror of hindsight.

Instead of letting [VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) take hold, and put off thinking about the terrible nightmare of upgrading yourwebsite again, think of it as a really big opportunity. _The tools are here, they’re just not evenly understood._ Better tools make better websites, and a better website should equate to a better customer service. It's just, like most paradigm shifts, we won't know this until time and experience grant us hindsight. Or until we have to go back and use the old tools.

<!-- Better modern web development tools are here. They’re just not evenly understood. But when the new tools become proven and normalised within the culture, then reverting back to old tools will become, well, painful. Just like my mechanic explained. Why wait until it’s obviously painful? 

so that you can own a first class website experience without digging yourself into maintenance hell where you fear updating or publishing -->


<!-- ## RJ

They matter because they have proven to be a more productive method to building user interfaces. Reactive Javascript libraries make it much easier to write code that is modular, understandable, with less bugs. This means you spend less time managing problems and more time focussing on your business goals:

- When state management is handled _reactively_ within the library by it's virtual DOM engine, rather than being intermingled within the real DOM, you can write declarative code that is more predictable, easier to understand and easier to debug.
- Because we're using a scripting to language to build UI, we can write encapsulated components that manage their own state. And we can then compose them to make complex UIs. Any logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, so we can easily pass rich data through the application and keep state out of the DOM.
- Reactive Javascript libraries are able to be rendered server-side. This does away with the historical complexity of old application frameworks that had huge setup and server management costs. And they were written in a completely different programming language, which you now don't need to learn or outsource for.
- Reactive Javascript can be adapted to any web technology: it’s modular. You can use it in VR as well as in a web page made of HTML. -->
