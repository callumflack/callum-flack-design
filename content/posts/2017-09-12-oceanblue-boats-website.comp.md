OceanBlue Boats had just moved into a new warehouse space that was four times larger. I
was asked to redesign their Branding and build a website around their love for all
things boat-making and general fabrication.

Vince, the owner, knows fishing boats. The website acts as a storybook, each page is a
chapter that talks about Vince's boat making specialty, what the new factory workspace offers, the fabrication processes used and the base boat designs they customise.

I worked with [J-Create Photography](http://j-create.com.au/) to capture the tight-knit team and the workshop space in action, portraying them as uncommon local craftspeople.

> We love our new website. It tells out story really well, and our clients have found it easy and fun to understand. Callum has understood who we build boats for, and why we do it. _â€” Vince Cassaniti, Owner_

Over time, we'll continue to document their boat-making and improve the website to suit their audience. This will leave Vince & his crew with more time to do what they do best.
