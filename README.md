# Callum Flack Design

Value proposition, portfolio and writing website: https://callumflack.design/

### Heads up!

This repo is very messy — unused components everywhere, commented out template elements, etc. This is I'm constantly evolving the design, and because I mostly design this website in the code and because I hate to lose ideas…

You'll also see the entire design history carefully noted in the branches.
