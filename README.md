# Callum Flack Design 

As of October 2022, this repo is no longer the source for [my website](https://callumflack.design/). But you can still check this old website at [v9.callumflack.design](https://v9.callumflack.design/)

### Heads up!

This repo is very messy — unused components everywhere, commented out template elements, etc. This is I'm constantly evolving the design, and because I mostly design this website in the code and because I hate to lose ideas…

You'll also see the entire design history carefully noted in the branches.
