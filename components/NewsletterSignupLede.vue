  p I write an email letter once or twice a month about visual design, user experience and website development systems through the lens of people and society. I can't help but follow my curiosity, searching for the "things inbetween". The key to generating insights is to notice things. It's generative. Even if your website comms feel okay, you just might get something out of reading it.
